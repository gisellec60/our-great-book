## *But existing is basically all I do!*

#### She also liked to shut up! Moving along… I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Meh.

Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died. I just told you! You've killed me! Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Interesting. **No, wait, the other thing: tedious.** *I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up!* Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas.

### *Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.*

I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! You can see how I lived before I met you. Look, last night was a mistake. Yeah, lots of people did. It's toe-tappingly tragic!

1. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!
2. It doesn't look so shiny to me.
3. I'm a thing.

*Bender, quit destroying the universe!*

Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Bite my shiny metal ass. Moving along… You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

- That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!
- Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it?
- Negative, bossy meat creature!

I'll get my kit! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

I never loved you. Okay, I like a challenge. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.

No, just a regular mistake. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Ooh, name it after me! It doesn't look so shiny to me. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".

Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Ask her how her day was. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

Shut up and take my money! Negative, bossy meat creature! Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Pansy.

This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Kif might! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso!

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

And I'm his friend Jesus. I never loved you. Now what? This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!

Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Guess again. No. We're on the top. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?

Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Can we have Bender Burgers again? What kind of a father would I be if I said no? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
